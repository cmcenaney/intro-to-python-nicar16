# #LISTS

# One of our favorite Python types is the list. 
# A list is an ordered collection of objects (variables, strings, integers, other lists, and more) 
# and is mutable. You create a list by assigning wrapping it in brackets and assigning it to a variable. 



# Because a list is a sequence (just as a string is a sequence of characters), we can also use 
# the slicing method to pull out specific items from the list.



# A list can also be CHANGED - with values added or swapped out 
# You add items to a list using the append() function



# Voila! Our list has now grown from four names to five
# You can also change one of the names based on their index position, which we dealt with above. 


# By using the index, we can change the value


#Now look what happens 


# You can also delete items from a list using the DEL command


# It's also possible to combine lists together or replicate them


#The same concepts work by using variables instead of raw values




# PROMPTING USERS TO ENTER VALUES
# You can also prompt users to enter a value that you assign to a variable, 
# then use it to make lists
# (note: this code should be run as a .py file via the command line, not in the interpreter)




#Now we'll use the two user-defined values to create a list





#FOR LOOPS

# Probably the most powerful (and potentially dangerous) thing to do with a list is to iterate over it using a for loop, 
# to perform some action on each item in the list.

# Let's start with a list of numbers
# note that numbers don't have quotes (") around them




# Now let's use a FOR LOOP to pull out each individual item in our list. 
# An important, though someone confusing aspect, is that the name you give to the "items" can be virtually anything.
# Below we've called it "item" but we could just as easily have called it "apple" or "elephant".
# It's best though to make it descriptive of what you're seeking so you can remember what it is you've done.




# Now watch this -- instead of just returning each individual number, let's
# do some math on each one. 
# Multiply each number on our list by 5 and give us the result.




# There are certain Python functions that create lists for you of certain types.
# For example, here is how you can easily make a list of sequential numbers based
# on their range.




# You don't have to start with zero - you can set any two values to find numbers between them



# If we want to save our list to actually use, we'll want to assign to a variable



# Now let's use a loop to print out each number in our range, which is a list



#The same concepts of LOOPS work for strings/text as well




# Now let's add on something truthful about these teams
