# Write a function to do some exploring with strings


    # Open the csv
    

    # Create the object that represents the data in the csv file
    

    # Create a variable to represent the header row
   

    # From the last lesson we know the variable header_row refers to a list.
    # Let's isolate the string that is 'Acquiring Institution'
    

    # We'll do this by isolating in the list what is know as the index of the string
    

    # Let's make sure this is a string
    

    # Let's get the length of the string
    

    # Create a variable to hold our string
    

    # Let's see how string subscripting works...
    # Let's print the third character
    

    # Let's print the first five characters
    

    # Let's print everything after the first five characters
    

    # Let's capitalize the first letter in the string


    # Let's lowercase the string
    

    # Let's uppercase the string


    # Close the csv file when we're done
    

# Call the function, passing as an argument the name of the csv file to open.
